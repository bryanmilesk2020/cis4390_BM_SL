## Business Point

https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/what-kind-of-records-should-i-keep

All small businesses need to keep records of various confidential information. For example, small business owners need to have employee taxes and information
on record for IRS review. 

## What records should this business dashboard allow the user to store?

**Gross receipts** (cash register tapes, deposit information, receipt books, invoices, forms 1099-MISC) that show the amounts and sources of gross receipts,

**Purchases** (canceled checks/documents reflecting proof of payment, cash register tape receipts, credit card receipts and statements, invoices) that identify 
payee, the amount paid, proof of payment, the date incurred, and include description of item, 

**Expenses** (canceled checks/documents reflecting proof of payment, 
cash register tape receipts, account statements, credit card receipts and statements, invoices) that identify the payee, the amount paid, proof of payment, 
the date incurred, and include a description of the item purchased or service received that shows the amount was for a business expense, 

**Travel, transportation, entertainment, and gift expenses** (if you deduct these expenses you must prove certain elements of expenses), 

**Assets** that information about your business assets. You need records to compute the annual depreciation and the gain or loss when you sell the assets (when and how you
acquired the assets, purchase price, cost of any improvements, Section 179 deduction taken, deductions taken for depreciation, deductions taken for casualty losses
such as from fires or storms, how you used the asset, when & how you disposed of the asset, selling price, expenses of sale), and 

**employment taxes** 
(employee ID number, amounts and dates of all wage, annuity, and pension payments, amount of tips reported, names, addresses, and SSNs of all employees,
dates of employment, periods of which employees took paid sick leave, copies of tax-withholding certificates, dates & amounts of tax deposits made,
copies of returns filed, records of allocated tips, records of fringe benefits provided, including substantiation).

## What will the project NOT do?

This project (business dashboard) is not a full business management system. It does NOT handle payroll, scheduling, customer databases, or supply chain logistics. 
The business dashboard is not a real time multi-user distributed blockchain. There are no peer-to-peer modes, network consensus, distributed syncing, or cloud 
blockchain clusters. This dashboard is not going to have predictive modeling capabilities, ML forecasting, etc. Analytics will only consist of totals, trends, 
and summaries. This tool is not a high-security enterprise compliance tool, it just demonstrates integrity with blockchain hashing. This dashboard also, will not 
handle cryptocurrency transactions.
